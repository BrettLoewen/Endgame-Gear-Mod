## Endgame Gear Mod

For Fabric.

Adds Dragonite gear to the end voids. Void debris can be found in sky geodes along with charoite blocks. Void debris can be smelted into dragonite scrap, which can be combined with charoite to craft dragonite ingots. These dragonite ingots can be used in a smithing table with the Dragonite Upgrade smithing template and diamond gear to create dragonite gear, including the chestplate which features a built-in elytra. The Dragonite Upgrade template, along with a new Dragon smithing pattern, can be found in the chests of end cities. You can also use charoite as a new smithing material. Craft a dragonite ingot together with gunpowder to create Dragonite Rockets, a durability-based alternative to normal firework rockets.

Adds Prismarine gear to the oceans of Minecraft. Prismatic ore can now be found in ocean pillars made of tuff, along with other prismarine blocks. This new ore can be smelted into prismarine scrap, and crafted into prismarine ingots. Use these ingots together with the Prismarine Upgrade smithing template found in treasure chests in a smithing table to upgrade diamond gear into prismarine gear.

The mod can be downloaded in the Releases tab of this repo.

Known issue: The charoite trim material does not appear in the armor icons, but still works correctly when worn.
